                    pre-soaking irrigation is given 3-4 days prior to transplanting. Before planting seedlings should be
                    dipped in a solution prepared by Nuvacron (15ml) and Dithane M - 45 (25g) in 10 litres of water for
                    5-6

                    low to medium rainfall. Bright sunshine at the time of fruit set helps to develop dark red coloured

                <p class="my-para__info margin-bottom-big">
                    High humidity, elevated temperatures, and lack of adequate air circulation are the three
                    environmental factors that favor the spread of foliar diseases. Prevention starts with adequate air
                    flow: do not crowd plants by planting them more densely than recommended; prune properly and
                    regularly; and ensure good ventilation if growing indoors. Because many diseases can be carried and
                    spread in water droplets or films, try to avoid handling plants when they are wet; and keep your
                    hands, garments, and pruning tools clean. Many foliar diseases can survive in plant residue from
                    season to season, so remove debris and practice crop rotations.

                    Verticillium wilt
                    Bacterial Speck (BS) on tomato leaf.

                    Common foliar diseases of tomatoes include:

                    Bacterial speck (Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato) • BS
                    Bacterial speck is a foliar disease that can also affect the fruit, whether green or ripe. On the
                    leaves, it is identified by minuscule dark spots; on green fruit, dark spots; and on ripe fruit,
                    sunken dark spots. It can reduce vigor and yield of plants, and make fruits
                    unpalatable/unmarketable.

                    While there are many varieties resistant to bacterial speck race 0, breeding has yet to achieve
                    varieties with resistance to race 1.

                    Gray leaf spot
                    Gray Leaf Spot (L) on tomato leaf.

                    Gray leaf spot (Stemphylium solani, S. lycopersici) • L
                    The most obvious sign of gray leaf spot is the development of small, dark-colored lesions on the
                    leaves that progress into dead leaf tissue. As a result, there is reduced productivity and
                    eventually leaf drop. Gray leaf spot is more common in southern states.

                    We have found that there are not as many high-quality commercial tomato varieties with grey leaf
                    spot resistance as there are with other resistances.

                    Gray leaf spot-resistant tomato varieties…

                    Early blight (Alternaria tomatophila and A. solani) • AB
                    Also known as Alternaria leaf blight, early blight is a widespread disease in which the older, more
                    susceptible lower leaves are the common initial site of infection. Lesions begin as small, dark,
                    irregularly shaped spots that progress into increasingly larger, concentric rings. The surrounding
                    tissues develop a yellow halo, and may resemble a bulls-eye target. As the disease develops, it can
                    cause leaf death and reduced yields. Although infection often begins in the lower portion of the
                    plant, it can extend into the upper leaves, and stems and fruits can be infected at any stage. Stem
                    infection can progress into Alternaria stem canker — see Stem Diseases below for more information.

                    Varieties with early blight resistance are fairly uncommon, and even in these varieties, resistance
                    does not confer complete immunity from the disease; rather, resistant plants are able to delay and
                    minimize disease symptoms long enough to sustain production.</p>

                    or red loam soils rich in organic matter with a pH range of 6.0-7.0 are considered as ideal.</p>
